Claude says I gotta use this as a reference to write content for this section. I'll update this when I find time.
<aside>

- **Your Persona Story:** Expand on your persona in a narrative format. Don't just list bullet points. Tell a story that connects your early start, your diverse experiences, and your passion for human potential. Weave in elements like:
    - "From building MVPs at 18 to leading product teams at 23..." (Highlights your rapid growth)
    - "...Driven by the belief that technology should empower, not overwhelm, people..." (Connects to your human capital vision)
    - "...Bridging the gap between technical complexity and human needs through design thinking and AI..." (Reiterates your core skills)
- **"My Approach to Product Building":** Use 3-4 concise bullet points or short paragraphs to highlight your key principles:
    - **Human-Centered by Design:** Emphasize your user research, empathy, and accessibility focus (Rapture, Effinity, WeCP examples).
    - **Data-Informed & Technically Grounded:** Highlight your engineering understanding and analytical approach (ClearFeed onboarding, WeCP AI, Mantrika.AI).
    - **Growth-Oriented & Scalable Solutions:** Showcase your growth mindset and experience with PLG, scaling (ClearFeed customer growth, WeCP ARR).
    - **Impact-Driven & Purposeful:** Reiterate your "human capital" vision and desire to solve meaningful problems (mention examples across your projects).
